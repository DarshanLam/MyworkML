2) Dataset 2: DIGIT RECOGNITION from IMAGES from Kaggle.com
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data?select=train.csv

3) there are two jupyter notebooks:
one for dataset 1, Homework1-Heart.ipynb   and 
one for dataset 2: HomeWork1-Digit.ipynb

4) The notebook starts with cells to import all the needed libraries and read in the data and set it up.
There a 5 sections in each in the following order, Decision trees, Nueral Networks, Boosting, 
Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbors.

5) Each section requires that the setup cells be run first and then the section code.

6) the code can be found in the following location:
